# VideoTerminal Screen I/O

## Motivation

This repository is part of my personal learning journey.

I build software to understand how things work internally, to experiment with
concepts, architectures and technical details, and to improve my engineering skills.

The focus of this project is exploration, learning and practical experience.
It is not a product and not intended to provide enterprise-level completeness.

## Usage

You are free to read, copy, modify and use the code.

If something works for you – great 👍  
If not – that is okay too - maybe we talk ...

## Support & Warranty

This project is provided as-is.

There is no guarantee that it is complete, correct or production ready.
Please evaluate and adapt it to your own needs.
